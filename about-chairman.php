                            <p> Even in these more glorious days of our beloved Trinity International College (or Trinity, as we fondly call her), it is difficult to resist the nostalgia of those days of small beginnings when we were frail and small, poor and lowly, obscure and perhaps, even ignored. For they were days of great missionary zeal and faith, of unparalleled commitment and rugged determination. The experiment that started in the early 1990s and became a reality on October 7, 1995, when we opened our doors to seven tiny children at No. 10, Adekunle Fajuyi Way, GRA Ikeja, has been remarkable in its challenges, growth, successes and achievements.</p>
                            <p>We started with God and with a great passion but little else. Yet, today, none of the stakeholders has been left unaffected.</p>
                            <p>Those seven tiny kids, the pioneers and those that joined them later, are now growing young men and women all over the world in various fields of human endeavor. After Trinity, they have been through universities in Nigeria, UK, USA, Canada and elsewhere; and have graduated with outstanding results, many prized laurels and other enviable testimonials. Besides, they have been equipped with credible life skills, the seeds of which were sown largely in our Trinity. Their parents too can proudly look back at the risky decision to patronize an untested College. The staff who gave up their various careers elsewhere to pitch their tents with infant Trinity have testimonies of life-changing encounters. The large number of visionary proprietors have a heartwarming testimony of what great things God, the Almighty, can do with willing, even if frail, hands. Indeed, in line with our motivation, many of our children have attended Trinity from inception to date.</p>

                            <p>Our baby has come of age in every aspect of College life and adolescent education and development. A big “Thank-you” to all for putting their faith in the uncertain experiment we commenced in the mid-nineties and in the certainly daring adventure of moving to our permanent site in unknown, unmapped, insect-and-animal-ridden Ofada outskirts in 1998.</p>

                            <p> The factors that gave us a burden to commence a Christian college that would gracefully blend academic excellence with spiritual and moral enlightenment and uprightness have become rather exacerbated since then. Many colleges of our kind are therefore needed all over this country today, if the future is to be assured. Indeed, our experiences these years have encouraged us to extend the Trinity brand: we now have a primary school – The Trinity Foundation School – also at Ofada and the Trinity University (TU) is in the offing.</p>

                            <p>It is therefore my honour and delight to commend to you – parents and prospective students – our Trinity. Although you will certainly miss the challenge, fun and excitement of our small and rustic beginning, many years ago, in the “Ofada bush”, you will be adequately compensated with extra curricula, mature premises, excellent facilities, seasoned and experienced staff, a truly committed board and management as well as our continuing spiritual flavor. Like those before you, you will be profoundly, permanently and positively affected and well-prepared to take your ordained places anywhere in the world and in any field of human endeavour to the glory of God and the eternal good of mankind.</p>

                            <p><strong> Welcome to the Trinity world!</strong> </p>

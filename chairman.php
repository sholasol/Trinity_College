                                    <span class="text-justify"> Even in these more glorious days of our beloved Trinity International College (or Trinity, as we fondly 
                                        call her), it is difficult to resist the nostalgia of those days of small beginnings when we were frail and
                                        small, poor and lowly, obscure and perhaps, even ignored. For they were days of great missionary zeal and 
                                        faith, of unparalleled commitment and rugged determination. The experiment that started in the early 1990s 
                                        and became a reality on October 7, 1995, when we opened our doors to seven tiny children at No. 10, Adekunle
                                        Fajuyi Way, GRA Ikeja, has been remarkable in its challenges, growth, successes and achievements.</span><br><br>
                                        <span class="text-justify">We started with God and with a great passion but little else. Yet, today, none of the stakeholders has been left unaffected.</span><br><br>
                                    <span class="text-justify">Those seven tiny kids, the pioneers and those that joined them later, are now growing young men and women all over the world in 
                                        various fields of human endeavor. After Trinity, they have been through universities in Nigeria, UK, USA, Canada and elsewhere; 
                                        and have graduated with outstanding results, many prized laurels and other enviable testimonials. Besides, they have been equipped
                                        with credible life skills, the seeds of which were sown largely in our Trinity. Their parents too can proudly look back at the risky
                                        decision to patronize an untested College. The staff who gave up their various careers elsewhere to pitch their tents with infant Trinity
                                        have testimonies of life-changing encounters. The large number of visionary proprietors have a heartwarming testimony of what great things
                                        God, the Almighty, can do with willing, even if frail, hands. Indeed, in line with our motivation, many of our children have attended
                                        Trinity from inception to date.</span>

                                        their faith in the uncertain experiment we commenced in the mid-nineties and in the certainly daring adventure of moving to our permanent 
                                        site in unknown, unmapped, insect-and-animal-ridden Ofada outskirts in 1998.</span><br><br>
                                    <span class="text-justify"> The factors that gave us a burden to commence a Christian college that would gracefully blend academic excellence with spiritual and moral 
                                        enlightenment and uprightness have become rather exacerbated since then. Many colleges of our kind are therefore needed all over this country 
                                        today, if the future is to be assured. Indeed, our experiences these years have encouraged us to extend the Trinity brand: we now have a primary 
                                        school – The Trinity Foundation School – also at Ofada and the Trinity University (TU) is in the offing.</span><br><br>

                                    <span class="text-justify">It is therefore my honour and delight to commend to you – parents and prospective students – our Trinity. Although you will certainly miss 
                                        the challenge, fun and excitement of our small and rustic beginning, many years ago, in the “Ofada bush”, you will be adequately compensated 
                                        with extra curricula, mature premises, excellent facilities, seasoned and experienced staff, a truly committed board and management as well 
                                        as our continuing spiritual flavor. Like those before you, you will be profoundly, permanently and positively affected and well-prepared to 
                                        take your ordained places anywhere in the world and in any field of human endeavour to the glory of God and the eternal good of mankind.</span><br>

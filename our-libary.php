                                        <p> Adequate health care facilities and a qualified medical team make ‘TRICOL’ stand out. Prompt medical services are provided by trained and experienced resident nurses.</p>
                                        <p>A medical doctor visits at least four times a week, and he is on call in cases of emergency. Each student is required to bring a medical report to the school on resumption. This helps the school have knowledge of the medical history of the child. Such records are kept in the clinic and the kitchen is notified if there is any food allergy. Invariably, all students are registered at the school clinic, and if, or whenever a child is too ill to attend classes, he/she is accommodated in the infirmary.</p>
                                        <p>Where a child requires more than minimal medical treatment, the child is either transferred to a bigger health facility or referred to the family doctor through the parents.</p>
